## Rubric
### Game Concept
8-Bit dungeon crawler game inspired by the Diablo franchise. Explore a 2-D isometric world, complete quests, and level-up your character to defete the darkness that is lurking in the shadows. You play as a young adventurer on a quest to save the human realm from this darkness.
### Level Design
This game does not use a level system. The difficulty of the game will follow the level of the player. As the player levels up, the game will become more difficult, items will be more diffficult to get, and the player will need to earn more xp to level up further.
